The results of the first video we had were not usable unfortunately, so after wasting money we were a bit sceptical about who we chose next.\\n\\nWe had a lot of extremely solid proposals for our project but something about Alex's stuck out.\\n\\nI cannot emphasise highly enough how happy we are with our choice.\\n\\nExperience\\nAlex clearly knows his way around a film set, (we don't). He pretty much directed the video singlehandedly, and suggested shots and extra footage that we would not have even thought were necessary, but have ended up being used in the video.\\n\\nLikeability\\nSeems minor but if you are going to spend a day with someone, it always helps if you like them as a person. Alex not only got on with us, but he interacted incredibly well with the actors and extras who he had only met for the first time. They clearly warmed to him immediately and took direction from him without question.\\n\\nDeliverables\\nAlex not only delivered a stunning final product, in order to get there, he displayed a huge amount of patience with the editing, took additional high quality still photos (which we didn't ask for, but can 100% be used on our future marketing material), and put us under no pressure to complete the project until we were more than happy.\\n\\nWe would not hesitate to recommend Alex to anyone who wants a quality video filmed and edited and if we need another video produced, we will head straight back to him.\",\n",

       " 'Lets start with the negatives:\\n1. The websites that my link was posted to seem like \"guest post farms\" meaning the sites consist of mainly guest posts, little non-sponsored content, and are from expired domains with different original topics. For example, a link of mine is on a site that was a former pottery studio according to WayBack Machine. Other sites had Asian language on them a few years ago according to WayBack Machine. To be fair to Steven, he does not explicitly state that this is \"blogger outreach\" which would be links authentic websites, but he also doesn\\'t say that these sites are \"guest post farms\" either. For the price of this service, I think the links are adequate, but if you are trying to run as white hat as you can get, I would avoid these. If you want something more legit than a PBN, then these would be better.\\n2. Steven was late around 7 days. I would add an extra 7 days to your delivery order if Steven doesn\\'t extend his deadline.\\n3. Four links had a Moz Spam Score of 2-3.\\n\\nPositives:\\n1. Link Metrics had an average DA of 20.\\n2. The content was well written with around 1-2 errors per post. The links were all do-follow and inserted within the body. All the posts made sense.\\n3. The sites all look like they could be an actual blog. If whoever owns these links would publish original content, then these sites would look legit minus the WayBack Machine.',\n",
